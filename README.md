# kitty-discord-bot

## Description
Basic bot to help moderate CryptoKitties' Discord. This is still in **ALPHA** and should be treated as such.


## Requirements
* Python3.6
* [Discord.py and its requirements.txt](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
* Set API keys as enviornment vars and follow Discord's steps to authorize a bot on a server

_I suggest using your own discord server for testing_
